## üß∞ Project Structure Explained

### Core Components

- `src/App.tsx` - Main application entry point and routing
- `src/pages/Home/join-room.tsx` - Room creation and joining interface
- `src/pages/Home/video-conference.tsx` - Video calling interface with controls
- `src/pages/Home/language-selector.tsx` - Language selection component
- `src/pages/Home/transcript-panel.tsx` - Real-time transcript and history

### Technical Components

- `src/hooks/useWebRTC.ts` - WebRTC connection management and media handling
- `src/config/socket.ts` - Socket.io configuration for signaling
- `src/config/constants.ts` - Application constants and configuration

## üîÑ How the Application Works

1. **Room Creation/Joining**:

   - User creates a new room or joins with a link
   - Room ID is generated or extracted from URL
   - Socket connection is established with the server

2. **Connection Establishment**:

   - WebRTC offers and answers are exchanged via Socket.io
   - ICE candidates are shared to establish the optimal connection path
   - Peer connection is established directly between participants

3. **Media Handling**:

   - Local audio/video streams are captured from user's device
   - Streams are shared with peers through WebRTC data channels
   - Controls allow toggling audio/video states

4. **Translation Features**:
   - Speech is captured and sent for processing
   - Translated text is displayed in the transcript panel
   - Users can view conversation in their preferred language

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **React** - UI framework
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **WebRTC** - Peer-to-peer media communication
- **Socket.io** - Signaling for WebRTC connection setup
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling and responsive design

## üåê Setting Up the Server

This client application requires a server component for signaling. See the server documentation in the project root for setup instructions.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting for Beginners

- **Camera/Microphone Issues**: Ensure you've granted the correct permissions in your browser
- **Connection Problems**: Check your internet connection and firewall settings
- **Room Joining Failures**: Verify the room ID is correct and the room exists
- **Video Quality Issues**: Try reducing background processes or connecting to a better network
